Today, you begin your journey with Emacs, /the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor/.

Because of its complexity, Emacs will seem difficult to grok. Rest assured that learning a select few features and packages more than suffices. This material is titled "Hacking Emacs", not only because a great deal of customization will be made, but also because you'll be learning packages that have been handpicked, to greatly boost your productivity with the least amount of learning time.

The tinkerer will marvel at the masterpiece which is Emacs. We hack on Emacs because we can; every facet of Emacs is extensible and customizable. Emacs is not for the faint of heart. Embrace the challenge, but most importantly enjoy the ride. I encourage you to be curious and playful throughout this course.

Atom users, go grab yourselves another cup of coffee while you wait for it to load up :P.
