* Managing the Workspace
It's common to want to create new windows in your Emacs frame to maximize screen estate and make editing easier.

| Key   | Window                            |
|-------+-----------------------------------|
| =C-x 0= | Delete current window             |
| =C-x 1= | Maximize current window           |
| =C-x 2= | Split current window /horizontally/ |
| =C-x 3= | Split current window /vertically/   |

** Winner-mode
/Winner-mode/ is a global minor mode. When activated, it allows you to "undo" and "redo" changes in the window configuration.

| Key       | Action      |
|-----------+-------------|
| C-c left  | =winner-undo= |
| C-c right | =winner-redo= |

The keybinding for switching between windows is =C-x o=, which I find overly complex for such an essential key.

** WindMove
/WindMove/ is a library included in Emacs starting with version 21. It lets you switch between windows using Shift + arrow keys. To activate it on startup, add the following piece of code in your =init.el=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(when (fboundp 'windmove-default-keybindings)
  (windmove-default-keybindings))
#+END_SRC

** Ace-window
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-window][ace-window]] lets you quickly switch between windows. It's the one I'm currently using, and I'm very happy with it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package ace-window
  :bind (("M-q" . ace-window)))
#+END_SRC

I'd bind it to =M-q=, or anything else you find convenient.
